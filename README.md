# so_long

**so_long** is a project developed with the goal of creating a simple 2D game using the MiniLibX graphics library. This project teaches fundamental concepts of game development, graphics manipulation, and event handling in C.

## Project Objectives

- **Introduction to Graphics Libraries**: Using MiniLibX to create windows, manipulate images, and handle keyboard and mouse events.
- **2D Game Development**: Creating a game where the player collects items and reaches an exit point.
- **Event Handling**: Implementing keyboard events to control the character and close the game.
- **Map Reading**: Reading a map from a `.ber` file and rendering it on the screen.

## Requirements

1. **Valid Maps**: The map must be rectangular, surrounded by walls, and contain at least one collectible item and one exit.
2. **Player Movement**: The player must be able to move around the map, collect items, and reach the exit.
3. **Move Count**: Display the number of moves made by the player on the screen.
4. **Event Handling**: Implement keyboard events (W, A, S, D for movement and Esc to exit).
